This chapter explains how to install Cuckoo.

Although the recommended setup is *GNU/Linux* (Debian or Ubuntu
preferably) Cuckoo has proved to work smoothly also on *Mac OS X* as
host; the recommended and tested setup for guests are *Windows 7* for
Windows analysis, *Mac OS X Yosemite* for Mac OS X analysis and Debian
for Linux Analysis, although Cuckoo should work with other releases of
guest os.

Note: This documentation refers to *Host* as the underlying
  operating systems on which you are running Cuckoo (generally being a
  GNU/Linux distribution) and to *Guest* as the Windows virtual
  machine used to run the isolated analysis.
